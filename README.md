# BaseAdapterRecyclerView
A simple app which has Base adapter for recyclerview.
If you project has lot of listing items then instead of creating a separate Adapter with all implemented methods, use this Base RecyclerView for clean and concise code.
For simplicity I have only used list of string instead of any model.
